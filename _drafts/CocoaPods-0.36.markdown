TL;DR: _CocoaPods 0.36_ has been released, with the long-awaited support for Frameworks and Swift.

<!-- more -->

The CocoaPods 0.36 brings long-awaited functionality: it initially supports dynamic framework and by that it also brings enhanced support for Apple's new programming language Swift.


## And there were Swift & Dynamic Frameworks on iOS

Dynamic frameworks have always been available on OS X. That's different for iOS. Apple's mobile platform does support dynamic frameworks initially with iOS 8.0. So the least common denominator was found before with using static libraries, which are supported on both platforms.

To the same time when Dynamic Frameworks were introduced, Apple also introduced Swift. If you have third-party dependencies in Swift, you have only two choices: Either throw them in your project and compile one fat binary, which is no practical solution as this increases build times by the lack of incremental compilation and makes it hard to generically manage very different dependencies, which could require different build settings etc. Or you can facilitate frameworks. Static libraries are not an option anymore.

Why is that the case? Because Swift is still very open in design and subject to heavy changes. Unlike Objective-C, Apple doesn't ship the Swift standard runtime libraries with iOS. This decouples the language version from the platform version. When you build an app with Swift, you're responsible yourself to ship them. The toolchain provides at this place `swift-stdlib-tool`, which [covers the common use cases](http://samdmarshall.com/blog/swift_and_objc.html). As those libraries can't be statically linked multiple times, and not at all in different versions. Furthermore it is desirable to embed them only once and not embedded multiple times, because of constraints to memory size and network speed, which are relevant for distribution.

With this release, we initially allow to use both in combination with CocoaPods. Your project will automatically migrated or integrated, if you depend on a pod which includes Swift source code.
Furthermore you can use it, if your deployment target on iOS is greater then 8.0 or you're targeting the OS X platform, by specifying `use_frameworks!` in your Podfile.
This is an all or nothing approach per integrated target, because as we will later see, we can't ensure to properly build frameworks, whose transitive dependencies are static libraries.
So this release goes along with probably one of the most drastic change set on the whole project, which makes no stop on CocoaPods itself, but also required similar changes to Xcodeproj as well.


## Dynamic Frameworks vs. Static Libraries

![Xcode Template/Product Icons]()

So what's the difference between those both product types?

Dynamic Frameworks are bundles, which basically means that they are directories, which have the file suffix `.framework` and Finder treats them mostly like regular files. If you tap into a framework, you will see a common directory structure:

They bundle some further data besides a binary, which is in that case dynamically linkable and holds different slices for each architecture. But that's only part, which static libraries covered so far. Belong the further data, there are the following:

* The public headers, which are stripped from the bundle for application targets, as those are only important to distribute the interface of the code for compilation. The public headers also include the generated headers for public Swift symbols, e.g. `Alamofire-Swift.h`.
* A code signature over the whole contents, which has to be (re-)calculated on embedding a framework into an application target, as the headers are stripped before.
* The resources, which are used by e.g. UI components, which the frameworks brings with it
* It can carry further dynamic frameworks and libraries, like e.g. the Swift runtime library. But since Xcode 6-beta7 dynamic frameworks don't include anymore the Swift runtime, they were compiled with, because this would led to duplication, if multiple frameworks are used. [We had to care about]() embedding all needed Swift runtime libraries only once into the application project.
* The clang module map, which is mostly an internal toolchain artifact, which carries declarations about header visibility and module link-ability.
* An Info.plist, which specifies author, version and copyright information.


### Caveats

One caveat about bundling resources is, that until now we had to embed all resources into the application bundle. This is referenced programmatically by `[NSBundle mainBundle]`. You as Pod author were able to use that kind of referencing to include resources you brought into the app bundle. But with frameworks, you have to make sure, that you reference them more specifically by getting a reference to your bundle like that:

```objective-c
[NSBundle bundleForClass:<#ClassFromPodspec#>]
```

```swift
NSBundle(forClass: <#ClassFromPodspec#>)
```

This will then work for both ways of integration.
There are only very rare cases, where you want to reference the main bundle directly or indirectly, e.g. by using `[UIImage imageNamed:]`.

The advantage, we have now with the improved resource handling is, that resources wouldn't conflict when they have the same names, because they are namespaced by the framework bundle. Furthermore we don't have to apply anymore the build rules ourself to the resources as e.g. asset catalogs and storyboards need to be compiled.


### More about Frameworks

If you want learn more about Frameworks, take a look into the [Framework Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Frameworks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000183-SW1). Even when this was not written specifically for the new Cocoa Touch Frameworks, how Apple calls them in their Xcode target template, those are mostly the same to the classic OS X frameworks, so this document is still a helpful introduction.


## Updating

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up-to-date.
